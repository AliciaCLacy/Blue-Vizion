## Overview

The PALM Device is a multi-module biometric intake unit designed to perform identity, document, and biometric verification for Blue Vizion’s unified intake workflow.  

It supports:

- Citizenship interpretation (audio → structured data)  
- Document capture and verification  
- Personal questions intake  
- Biometric palm and thumb authentication  
- Estate, lineage, and descendant checks  
- Secure ledger-bound output  
# PALM Device Overview  
Corporate Engineering Summary

## Purpose
The PALM Device is designed to support the complete Blue Vizion Identity Intake Workflow, integrating multiple sensing, scanning, and verification modules into a single physical unit.

## Key Functions
- Voice intake (citizenship translator)  
- Document scanning  
- Biometric capture (palm and thumb)  
- Identity verification  
- Document authentication  
- Data transfer to Blue Vizion Worker API  
- Lineage & estate verification support  
- Ledger-bound output packaging  

## Target Deployment
- Intake offices  
- Remote-field verification stations  
- Estate-lineage adjudication centers  
- Mobile identity teams  
# PALM Device — Process Integration Blueprint

This document explains how the PALM device integrates into the Blue Vizion 20-step Intake Workflow.

## Blueprint Reference
**Image:** `images/palm-device-blueprint.png`

The blueprint outlines:

### 1. Octagonal Frame  
Structural housing for all primary modules.

### 2. Document Verification Rails  
Two angled rails guiding physical documents across the scanning sensor.

### 3. Biometric Thumb Module  
Capacitive or optical sensor for thumb authentication.

### 4. Palm Seal Surface  
Top-surface palm biometric reading area (vein + print).

### 5. Power and Data Ports  
Rear panel ports for power input & data transmission (USB-C / PoE).

### 6. Directional Intake Flow  
Arrows indicate user-guided workflow:
- Document → biometric → confirmation → ledger packet.
