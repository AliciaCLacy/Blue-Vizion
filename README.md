# Blue-Vizion
Blue Vizion is a biometric intake and ledger system built to unify service codes, candidate pools, and equity redistribution within a clause‑bound framework. It operates as a secure infrastructure where every intake, update, and ledger entry is authenticated by lineage and sealed into covenant records.
